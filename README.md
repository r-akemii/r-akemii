- 📚 I have a master degree in Transportation Engineering.
- 📚 I'm currently reading *Blood of Elves*, written by Andrzej Sapkowski.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and optimization models!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and improving my abilities with some libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn, and Gurobi.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects in which I can learn a lot!
